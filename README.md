# Generic Cover Letter

Dear whom it may concern,

Hope this finds you well!

I'm reaching out because I've seen `XXX` is recruiting for the `XXX` and I'd love to put my name forward. I've recently stopped `working/studying` at `XXX` in a `XXX capacity` and have over `X`+ years of `XXX`, `XXX` and `XXX` experience.

Why me?

I believe that aligning yourself with the company that is working on the projects you are most passionate about, intellectually interested in and has the most similar values to you, will unleash your potential and allow you to produce your best work. For me, that starts with my love for `XXX`. I thought it was worth a shot seeing as you guys are nailing it!

For a brief overview of what I'd bring to the table:

- `POWER STATEMENT` - I DID SOMETHING AND RESULTED IN X% IMPROVEMENT FOR Y
- `POWER STATEMENT` - IMPROVED WIDGET BY 15% BY LEADING TEAM AND IMPLEMENTING AWESOME THING HERE
- `POWER STATEMENT` - MORE AWESOME SAUCE

Would you like to have a chat so I give a brief walkthrough of the impacts/results that I've had so far and so you or one of the team can evaluate whether there would be a benefit to your business?

Kind regards,

`Me`
